# Global-Healthcare-Decision-Support-Platform [ ACADEMIC PROJECT2 ]
Healthcare-Treatment-Recommendation-System using python



In today's fast-paced world, the healthcare industry is continuously evolving, driven by the integration of technology and artificial intelligence. Despite these advancements, one major challenge persists — helping individuals make informed decisions about their treatment options without immediate access to a healthcare professional.
To address this, we present an innovative AI-powered solution: **Healthcare Treatment Recommendation System** — a smart web-based application built using Python and Flask.
This project simulates an expert panel discussion among AI-powered bots representing different continents. By analyzing treatment options based on factors such as **success rate, cost, and advantages**, the system delivers personalized and intelligent recommendations to users.
The platform merges backend logic with an interactive frontend to ensure a seamless and educational experience for users seeking preliminary treatment insights.
The motivation for this project arises from the global need for **accessible, reliable, and fast preliminary medical advice**, especially in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. This system aims to:
- Provide globally-informed treatment suggestions
- Bridge regional healthcare practice gaps
- Educate users on available treatment strategies worldwide

# Objective
- 🗺️ Six AI-powered bots representing **Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia**
- 📊 Analysis of region-specific treatment datasets stored in CSV files
- 🤖 Simulated bot discussion and voting mechanism
- 📈 Continent-wise success rate visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- 🖥️ Responsive, user-friendly frontend with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**
- 🔄 Real-time treatment recommendation based on rule-based consensus logic
# Tech Stack
- **Python 3(Spyder)**
- **Flask (Backend Framework)**
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend)**
- **Matplotlib (Data Visualization)**
- **CSV Files (Data Storage)**
# How It Works
1. User inputs the name of a disease.
2. Each continent-bot queries its regional dataset to analyze:
   - Treatment methods
   - Success rates
   - Complications
   - Advantages
3. Bots engage in a structured discussion, presenting their recommended treatment.
4. A rule-based system compares success rates and complications.
5. The system finalizes a globally-informed treatment recommendation.
6. Success rates are visualized using interactive bar charts.
