# Global-Healthcare-Decision-Support-Platform [ACADEMIC PROJECT2]
Healthcare-Treatment-Recommendation-System using python

In today's fast-paced world, the healthcare industry is continuously evolving, driven by the integration of technology and artificial intelligence. Despite these advancements, one major challenge persists ‚Äî helping individuals make informed decisions about their treatment options without immediate access to a healthcare professional.
To address this, we present an innovative AI-powered solution: **Healthcare Treatment Recommendation System** ‚Äî a smart web-based application built using Python and Flask.
This project simulates an expert panel discussion among AI-powered bots representing different continents. By analyzing treatment options based on factors such as **success rate, cost, and advantages**, the system delivers personalized and intelligent recommendations to users.
The platform merges backend logic with an interactive frontend to ensure a seamless and educational experience for users seeking preliminary treatment insights.
The motivation for this project arises from the global need for **accessible, reliable, and fast preliminary medical advice**, especially in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. This system aims to:
- Provide globally-informed treatment suggestions
- Bridge regional healthcare practice gaps
- Educate users on available treatment strategies worldwide

# Objective
- üó∫Ô∏è Six AI-powered bots representing **Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia**
- üìä Analysis of region-specific treatment datasets stored in CSV files
- ü§ñ Simulated bot discussion and voting mechanism
- üìà Continent-wise success rate visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- üñ•Ô∏è Responsive, user-friendly frontend with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**
- üîÑ Real-time treatment recommendation based on rule-based consensus logic
# Tech Stack
- **Python 3(Spyder)**
- **Flask (Backend Framework)**
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend)**
- **Matplotlib (Data Visualization)**
- **CSV Files (Data Storage)**
# How It Works
1. User inputs the name of a disease.
2. Each continent-bot queries its regional dataset to analyze:
   - Treatment methods
   - Success rates
   - Complications
   - Advantages
3. Bots engage in a structured discussion, presenting their recommended treatment.
4. A rule-based system compares success rates and complications.
5. The system finalizes a globally-informed treatment recommendation.
6. Success rates are visualized using interactive bar charts.
